#  This script will only run on eggdrop 1.5.5 or greater.

##
# This script will warn/kick/ban users that are found in banned channels.  You
# can specify what channel masks are to be banned on the fly via dcc console.  A
# channel mask, if you don't know, is a glob type masking of the channel name
# (ie:  *cl* could match #tcl or #clown or any other channel name with a cl in
# it).
##

##
# Commands
##
# DCC:
#   banchans [channel|global|all]
#     This will show you a list of banned channels for the particular channel.
#     If #channel is not specified, it will default to 'all'.
#
#   banchans scan [channel]
#     This will force the bot to scan all users on the specified channel.  If no
#     channel is specified, then it will scan all channels.
#
#   +banchan <channel|global> <#banned_channel> [reason]
#     This will add a new channel ban either globally or to a specific channel.
#     #banned_channel can be masked using the '*' as you wish.
#
#   -banchan <channel|global> <#banned_channel>
#     This will remove a channel ban from the global list or a specific channel.
#     #banned_channel can be masked using the '*' as you wish.
#
#   chanset [channel] <+/->mc.ban_channel
#     This will either enable (+) or disable (-) the script for the specified
#     channel.  By default, channels are disabled untill otherwise set.
#
# If you specify [channel] then the command is channel specific, otherwise
# is global.
#
# <channel> for the add/remove can contain wildcards, incase you want to
# ban certain words in channels names.  Ie. *pre*teen*  *sex*  or whatever.

# Settings

#

# What flagged users are able to utilize the 'banchans' DCC command?  Set this
# to -|- to ensure anyone has access (provided they can DCC chat the bot).

# What flagged users are able to utilize the '-banchan' DCC command?  Set this
# to -|- to ensure anyone has access (provided they can DCC chat the bot).
set mc_banc(access:-banchan) m|m

set mc_banc(ig:op) 1

# [0=no/1=yes] Do you want to exempt voiced users?
set mc_banc(ig:voice) 1

# How long, after the user join's the channel, do you want to wait before
# scanning him/her for banned channels?  This will better 'un lag' the bot by
# scanning only those whom appear to want to stay in the channel.  Set this
# value in seconds.
set mc_banc(flytime) 10

# How often do you want to re-scan the users to see if they have join'd a banned
# channel?  Set this value in minutes, 0 will turn off the re-scan ability --
# therefor users only get scanned upon join'n the channel.
set mc_banc(scan) 30

# What do you want the script to do if someone is found in a banned channel?
#   -2 = Send a warning.
#   -1 = Kick the user from the channel.
#    0 = Ban the user from the channel (server ban only).
#    1 and up is to be considered ban time in minutes, to be added to the bot's
#      internal ban list.  If you pre pend the number with a !, the ban will be
#      sticky.  Also, if you append the number with a @, the ban will be global.
#      Example:  !5@  (sticky global ban that expires in 5 min's)
set mc_banc(pre:pun) -2

# If 'pre:pun' is set to either -2 or -1, you can specify here when you want to
# rescan the user to ensure he/she isn't in any banned channels.  This value
# should represent minutes.
#   Example;  Send them a warning to leave a certain banned channel within 1
#             minute or else.  Then set here to re-scan them in 1 minute.
# You can set this to 0 if you like, this will have the script not rescan upon
# initial warning.
set mc_banc(warn:time) 1

# Specify your message here.  This will be used for the warning (if 'pre:pun' is
# set to -2), for the kick message (if 'pre:pun' is set to -1) or the ban
# comment (if 'pre:pun' is set to 1 or above).  The first word in this should
# represent either 'PRIVMSG' or 'NOTICE'.  If this is to be used for sending a
# warning, then that's the method in witch it's sent.  Otherwise the first word
# is just ignored.  Even if this is to be used for something other than a
# warning, you must still supply a first word witch will be ignored (just leave
# it set to 'PRIVMSG' or something, doesn't matter -- just going to be ignored).
#   Replacment variables, variables that are going to be replaced with there
#   proper value are listed below:
#     %banned_mask    - The banned channel mask the user triggered when being
#                       scanned.
#     %banned_channel - The banned channel that was found with the banned
#                       channel mask (the exact channel name of the channel in
#                       question).
#     %channel        - The channel that doesn't want this 'banned channel'
#                       associated with (simply put, the channel the bot is
#                       monitoring, associated with that user).
#     %reason         - The reason for the banned channel mask, specified when
#                       the ban channel mask is added via dcc command.
# This can support multi lines, specify each new line with a new line.  Also,
# don't forget the 'PRIVMSG' or 'NOTICE' for each new line.  Multi lines are
# only used for warning messages.  If ban command or kick message, only the
# first line is used (from the second word to the end of the first line, of
# course).
set mc_banc(warn:msg) {
  PRIVMSG You have 1 minute to leave %banned_channel.
  PRIVMSG Failure to do so will result in you being banned in %channel.
}

# Users only get 1 warning, if they use up that warning then what do you want
# this script to do?
#   -1 = Kick the user from the channel.
#    0 = Ban the user from the channel (server ban only).
#    1 and up is to be considered ban time in minutes, to be added to the bot's
#      internal ban list.  If you pre pend the number with a !, the ban will be
#      sticky.  Also, if you append the number with a @, the ban will be global.
#      Example:  !5@  (sticky global ban that expires in 5 min's)
set mc_banc(post:pun) 5

# What kick message (if 'post:pun' is set to -1) or ban comment (if 'post:pun'
# is set to 1 or above) do you want for users that have exceeded there warnings?
#   Replacment variables, variables that are going to be replaced with there
#   proper value are listed below:
#     %banned_mask    - The banned channel mask the user triggered when being
#                       scanned.
#     %banned_channel - The banned channel that was found with the banned
#                       channel mask (the exact channel name of the channel in
#                       question).
#     %channel        - The channel that doesn't want this 'banned channel'
#                       associated with (simply put, the channel the bot is
#                       monitoring, associated with that user).
#     %reason         - The reason for the banned channel mask, specified when
#                       the ban channel mask is added via dcc command.
# Unlike 'warn:msg', witch uses the same replacement variables, you do not need
# to specify 'PRIVMSG' nor 'NOTICE' as the first word -- nor does this support
# multi lines.  For, this is surely not being used to send messages, only kick
# message or ban comments.
set mc_banc(post:msg) "You were warned to leave %banned_channel.  %reason"

# How do you want to bans that supplied by this script to be masked?

#         2 - *!*@host.domain

#         7 - nick!*@host.domain
#         8 - nick!*user@*.domain
#         9 - nick!*@*.domain
#       You can also specify a type of 10-19 which corresponds to types 0-9,
#       using this sub rule;  If host.domain is a(n)-
#         name - Instead of using a * wildcard to replace portions of the
#                host.domain, it replaces the numbers in the host.domain with a
#                '?' (question mark) wildcard.
#         ip   - It will mask as normal, with no '?' (question mark)
#                replacements as does hostname.
